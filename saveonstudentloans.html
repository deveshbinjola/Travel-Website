<h4><b>Why do student need Credit Cards?</b></h4>
<p>Your credit score can impact your ability to rent an apartment, take a car loan or a student loan. The better credit score you have the better interest rates you will get for your loans. That's why building credit from an early age is important and what's better than starting as a college student. 
<br>
If you want to get started with credit while you're in college, a student credit card is what you should be looking for. You can get a Student credit card or a normal credit depending on your credit history.</p>

    <div class="lower">
        Great no annual fee cards.
    </div>

<br>

<br>
<h4><b>How do I rank a Credit cards for Students?</b></h4>
<p>The first assumption I make is assuming a no-credit history or very limited credit history. Almost all the cards for students have same benefits but there are few things which make them unique and easy to get approve:
<ul>
  <li><b>Annual Fee</b>: I would recommend to get a no annual fee card; as a student you don't need to pay for any unwanted fee. I have not included any card with an annual fee.</li>
  <li><b>Rewards:</b> One of the main reasons of getting credit cards is for its rewards and this is one main reasons to differentiate among cards. Your'e cards can reward you with cashback or points on eligibe purchases.</li>
  <li><b>APR (Introductory APR):</b> APR is the interest that you pay if you don't pay your credit card balance in full at the end of your statement. There are many credit cards that offer you 0% Introductory APR for first 12-21 months. </li>
  <li><b>Acceptance Rate:</b> Most college students have limited experience with credit history and with credit cards, so acceptance rate matters for students. There is no real number for acceptance rates, but from data points and customer interactions we get to know that which cards are easier to get. Chase cards are hard to get as your first credit card but BOFA, Capital One and Discover cards are really easy to get even without any credit history.</li>
  <li><b>Sign up bonus:</b> Sign up bonuses are bonus offers when you get as a welcome gift for applying and getting approved for the credit card.</li>

</ul></p>
