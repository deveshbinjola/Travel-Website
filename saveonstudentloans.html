        <p>Well this site is for students and how can we don’t have a post on paying off student loans. Student loans are one of the biggest debts in our economy and students have been struggling to pay them off and almost every student has a lot of debt on student loans. And I don't want banks to make money off my friends. So to make your life easier I am here to tell you 7 legit ways to pay off student loans really quick. I used these ways to pay off my loans pretty quick and I hope these work for you guys as well.</p>

<br>

<ol>
  <li><b>Get a job:</b> You should do whatever to find a job. If you went to college you should have a degree and it should not be that difficult to find a job. When you start a job, and you get two paychecks every month, try spending one of them on rent, groceries, gas, parties and other stuff and the other paycheck try putting it all on your student loan account. </li>

  <li><b>Autopayments:</b> Put your account on auto payment. It saves 0.5% APR. You can also keep all other loans on auto payment, it help you save money. One other thing you guys can do is to pay 2 installmants/payments every month.</li>

  <li><b>Have a great Credit History:</b> You need to have a great great credit history in order to get better APR offers for student loans or even any other loans. Check here to know how to make a great credit history.</li>

  <li><b>Refinance:</b> I believe when you apply for student loans and you are new to credit and don’t have a great credit history so you get a high APR, but after a year or couple of years or even after you are graduated, you credit history is better and you believe you can get a better APR. You should apply for Refinancing and that’s what our friends at <b> <a href="https://lendedu.com/">lendedu </a></b>exactly do. They help you to refinance your student loans and for free just like me. You can save a lot of money by refinancing your student loans. Imagine you are paying 8 % APR right now and if they help you refinance it to a 4%. You are saving so much money which you spend somewhere else like for a date or something else you want to do. They also help you refinance other loans aswell. So go check them out.</li>

  <li><b>Use Credit Card for all your purchases:</b> Always use your credit card for the purchases you make. Let me tell you Why? Imagine you spend 2000 every month on different things and you spend it using your debit card or cash instead credit card. You most probably loose minimum of 24000 points or $240. And you also pay it upfront. If you spend using your credit card, you have time to pay it off (minimum of 25 days to a maximum of 55 days) and you can use this money to pay off your student loans during that time. </li>

  <li><b>Plan Early:</b> Well I planned to payoff student loans way early and if you are still in college and reading this article you can start quick too. So one thing I did was to rack up few credit cards and id no spend on them after getting the bonus. So how does it help? So when you don’t spend money on your credit card, Credit card companies often send you 0% APR checks to spend with 2, 3% fee. </li>

  <li><b>Save on Taxes and use that money pay the loan: </b>Graduates of eligible colleges and universities can qualify to have $2,500 deducted from their Adjusted Gross Income, which reduces total taxable income. People earning over $80,000 are not eligible, however, and those earning between $65,000 and $80,000 can only deduct a portion of $2,500. The money you save on taxes put it back on your student loan account.</li>

</ol>

<p>Well I care for you guys and I don’t want you guys to pay extra money and that is why i created this  post to help you guys. So if you like it, like us on Facebook, twitter or instagram to make sure you can see more posts from us which can save you money.
