<h2>Here are few tips to kick start your life in United States</h2>  

<!-- START THE Left Column -->

<div class ="col-sm-8">

  <br>
  <h4><b>Start with your bank account.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  You surely need a bank account in United States. The best banks here are:
  <ol>
    <li>Bank of America</li>
    <li>Chase Bank</li>
    <li>Wells Fargo</li>
    <li>Citi Bank</li>
  </ol>
  Bank of America and Chase are my best choices. Students account are free of costs without any monthly or annual fee. You can also earn some money while opening up accounts, <a href="#">check out the post here.</a> Someone many colleges participate with banks which helps students to do their transactions swiftly, so do try to check with your school or seniors. I will also recommend to try to open a account in a Credit Union, it can help you in future.<b><a href="#"> Check out how?</a></b>
  </p>

 <br>
  <h4><b>Getting a phone connection.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  Getting a phone connection in USA is not as easy as it is in India, Japan or other countries. The cheapest mobile carriers are Lyca-Mobile, T-Mobile. AT&T and Verizon are great options but are costly, and I won't recommend  spending too much on carrier services. <b>My best advice will be to get into someone's family plan (like you family, friends, or even your seniors). Getting into family plans makes phone services cheaper.</b>
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4><b>Finding a Part-time on campus job and getting your SSN.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  The only way of getting your SSN in United States as a student is to get an on-campus job after you arrive. You can only get an internship after you are enrolled in a degree for atleast 9 months. Finding an on-campus is tricky and most students get on-campus jobs in their second semester after they make contacts and know the places which can offer them on-campus employment. I highly recommend new international students to arrive a little early (you can arrive 30 days before your program start date) and start making contacts. Arriving early helps to you to interact with your seniors and you are one step ahead of your batch mates. Talking to your seniors will help you know where to appply for jobs. Every college have different places which offer jobs, the most common are the <b>Student Union, Library, Dining, Teaching and Research Assitants, IT Services and Computer Labs</b>. Many colleges in United States offer scholarships or even tuition waiver if you get a Teaching or Research assitant job under any professor. Having an on-campus job can earn you around $1000 per month which can be highly helpful in managing your expenses and even help you in paying your tuition fee. The best part of it is you can get your SSN through it and you can start your credit early.
  </p>
  

 <br>
  <h4><b>Calling back home.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  Nowadays with the rise of Whatsapp Calling it is really easy and free to call back home. Still sometimes you might need calling cards or any calling plan for calling back home. There are many calling services available but I highly recommend <a href="#">Skype Calling</a>. You can easily load balance and even use it for other services like Skype Wi-Fi and more things. There are also many deals for Sype credit, like I got a $25 Skype credit for $16 from Newegg.
  </p>
  
  <br>
  <h4><b><a href="firstcard">Applying your first Credit Card!</a></b><br>
  </h4><p>
  Applying for a credit card is really necessary to start your credit history, <b><a href="whydoyouneedacreditcard">read here why?</a></b>
  People always think about which credit card to get first and how to get it. <a href="firstcard">Check this post to get the detailed explaination about which credit card to get first and how to get your <b>first credit card.</a></b>
  </p>

 <br>
  <h4><b>Shopping in United States.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  Shopping is really exciting here, <b><a href="howtoshoponline">check out this post to see how to shop online?</a></b> I really suggest people to get <a href="www.costco.com">Costco membership</a>, the membership costs from $55 but it is more than worth it. Walmart is also a good option if you don't want to spend on membership. Indian groceries are also available in United States, there are a lot of Indian grocery stores and even many indian grocery items are also available in Costco.
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4><b>Travel around United States.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  United States is one of the most beautiful country in the world. Studying is important but travelling is also important. <b><a href="www.thetravelstudent.com">Check out my website to explore more about travelling around United States and how to travel for cheap.</a></b>
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4><b>Finding Housing/Accomodation.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  You can find temporary accomodation/housing with your seniors by joing the groups of your colleges on Facebook or Whatsapp. You can also find accomodation on <b><a href="http://us.sulekha.com">Sulekha.com</a></b>. This website also has a lot of other stuff helpful for your stay.
  </p>

<br>
  <h4><b>Partying in United States.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  Its really easy to party here in US. Most of the nighclubs are 21+ but few are 18+ too. There is a really good website for free VIP passes within California (<a href="www.bangvip.com">Check out here</a>).
  </p>

  <br>
  <h4><b>Cricket in United States.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  There are a lot of sports played in United States, American football, Baseball and Basketball are the most popular. But Cricket and Soccer are also played all around US, there are many leagues and tournaments in many different cities of US. So have fun playing.

  </p>

<br>
  <h4><b>Making Contacts and finding internships/jobs.</b><br></h4>
  <p>
  <b>Reference is the king in United States.</b> So making contacts here is one of key factors of your successful stay in United States.
