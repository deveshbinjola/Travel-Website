  <h4><b><li>Credit Card Sign Up Bonuses</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>
  You can earn the major portion of your reward points through credit card bonuses which range from 10,000 Points to 100,000 Points. </p>

  <h4><b><li>Credit Card Rewards</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>
  Credit card rewards means the points you earn by spending through your credit cards. Every card ofers different type of reward points. </p>

<center>
    <img src="Image/goldpremier.png" class="img-responsive" > 
    <div class="lower">

    </div>
</center> 


  <h4><b><li>Earn Rewards from Banking</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>You can earn points and miles or cash for opening a new checking or saving acoount. There are some debit cards which offers points or miles on transactions.<br> Citi had an offer of 40,000 Thank you Points or 30,000 AA miles for opening a new Gold Checking account and keeping for 3 months.<br><br><a href="https://www.chase.com/checking/chase-coupon" target="_blank">Chase has offers for both their Checking and Saving accounts but they give cash instead of any points. Get you coupon from here.</a></p>
  <img src="Image/chaseoffer.png" class="img-responsive">

<br><br>
  <h4><b><li>Credit Card Offers</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>Credit Card companies like American Express, Chase and others have special offers for their customers (sometimes the offers are targeted) which earns extra points or gives you extra discounts. American Express offers most number of offers like these. <a href="https://twitter.com/AmexOffers">Subscribe to AMEX offers twitter channel to keep updated their latest offers.</a> <br>Few good offers they recently have:

<br>
  <h4><b><li>Shop online through different rewards programs</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>Whenever you are shopping online, do not shop directly from retailers website if possible. Click through one of the online mileage malls and you will automatically get points for every dollar you spend. It will give you points or miles just for shopping whatever you want. This is kind of great freebie to earn miles and points but people seem to ignore it as they think it takes a lot of time. It does not take more than few seconds of your time. <br><br>

  Just find out the rewards program you would like to earn points for, bookmark it and then whenever you want to anything online go to the merchant website from their link and you will automatically earn a lot of points for whatever you shop. Few major airlines shopping portals are listed below:
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.alaskaair.com/MileagePlanShopping/SignIn?lid=nav:mileagePlan-shopearn-signin">Mileage Planâ„¢ shopping</a></li>
    <li><a href="http://www.skymilesshopping.com">Skymiles Shopping</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.aadvantageeshopping.com">AAdvantage eShopping</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://shopping.mileageplus.com">Mileage Plus Shopping</a></li>
  </ul></p>


  <h4><b><li>Sign up for dining programs</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>Signing up for dining programs is also a freebie as you earn miles or points every time you swipe you use your linked credit cards at participating restaurants. Just try to link your credit card (the one you use most for dining) with the dining programs.<br>
  Here is alist of different dining programs:
  <ol>
    <li><a href="https://mileageplan.rewardsnetwork.com">Alaska Mileage Plan (1,000 Bonus Points)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://aa.rewardsnetwork.com/join">American Airlines Dining Rewards</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://skymiles.rewardsnetwork.com/join">Delta Dining Rewards</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.hhonorsdining.com/join">Hilton Honors Dining Rewards</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://ihgrewardsclubdining.rewardsnetwork.com/join">IHG Dining Rewards (1,000 Bonus Points)</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://www.rapidrewardsdining.com/join">Southwest Dining Rwards</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://mpdining.rewardsnetwork.com">United Dining Rewards</a></li>
    
    

  </ol>
</p>
    <h4><b><li>Earn Rewards for other big purchases</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>You can earn points and miles for buying a car or a house. You just need to ask the dealer that if he offers any rewards like miles and points with the purchase. Don't be shy in asking, many dealers have different offers but no one knows about them because no one ever asks. Or you can with your credit card, same some dealers might allow you so just try to check with them.<br>
  You can also pay your rent through your credit card. <a href="post3">Check this post to find out how?</a></p>



  <h4><b><li>Refer Friends for Points</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>One other major way to earn points and miles is by referring your friends for different credit cards. You earn 2,500 - 10,000 points per referral. Banks like <a href="https://www.chasereferafriend.com/Default.aspx?6f6dc9b9b2944db0a931f97fc678e1d0" target="_blank">Chase</a>, American Express allows to refer friends. Unfortunately Citi does not give any rewards for refering friends.</p>


   <h4><b><li>Earn Rewards by signing up for survey sites</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>You can also earn points and miles for doing surveys. You can do these surveys if you hve free time. I don't usualy like to do them but I do only when I find a really good deal. I did a survey for Mobile phones in which I have to do a in-store survey foe buying mobile phone. I just had to answer 4-5 quick questions and upload 2 pictures of the store. Luckily I was buying a new phone at that time sowithout wasting any time I earned around $40 worth of e-rewards cash which is redeemable at various places and loyalty programs. I personally like them to redeem for hertz points as it helps to rent cars for free and I believe we rent cars for every trip. It saves me money there. Some of the survey sites are:
  <ol>
    <li><a href="">E-Rewards</a></li>
    <li><a href="">E-miles</a></li>
  </ol></p>

   <h2>OTHER WAYS FOR CHEAPER TRAVEL.</h2>
  </div>
<ol>
<h4><b><li>Mistake Fares</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>Mistakes Fares happen more often than not. You just have to be lucky to know about it at the right time. Last year a President Suite in Grand Hyatt, Santiago, Chile worth more than $1000 a night was available $5 per night just because of a mistake fare. Ther are many more stories like that where super expensive airline or hotel tickets were available for super cheap. You just need to subscribe to my newsletter or follow us on <a href="">Twitter</a> to keep in touch with all these offers.</p>


  <h4><b><li>Bonus Free Nights</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>Many Credit Cards like Citi Prestige offers 4th night free on reservation for 4 or more nights which saves a lot of money if you are frequent traveller.</p>

  <h4><b><li>Stopovers</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>Stopovers are really helpful if you travel cheaply and it is one of the most important trick to redeem points. United offers one stopover and two open jaws with every round trip.<a href="redeemingmiles"></a>> You can check more about stopovers here.</a> </p>

  <h4><b><li>Checking fo better seats or getting bumped off the flight</b><br></h4></li>
  <p>You should always check with airline staff or hotel staff about a better seat o room. I have been upgraded to Business class ona Etihad Flight from Abu Dhabi to San Francisco just for asking them a better seat. <br><br>
  You can also volunteer to get bumped off the flight to earn big rewards from airlines. It works when certain flights, routes and airlines often oversell flights and some people are okay to over pay to get in the flight. Bumping off can help you earn many rewards.</p>


  </ol>
  <br>
         <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>These are some simple tips and tricks to cheaper you travel using credit cards and other stuff. You just need to use the right credit cards at right plaves and through right places to earn huge number rewards. I would recommend all my readers or anyone else who are using credit cards to pay their balance in full every month. Credit card companies have a lot of offers and they compensate these offers by charging a hefty APR (generally around 12% - 20%). Also paying your credit cards in full every month keeps your credit score healthy so I will urge everyone to pay their credit cards in full every month.</p>
