  As Spring break is arriving in couple of weeks, I just want to post my last year's Spring Break road trip report which spanned across California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. It was one of the best road trips I ever had. I called this trip <b>The Four States</b> as I was with my 4 other friends and we travelled across 4 different states. Here is the complete detail of my trip which may help you in planning your trip in future.</p>

<b>Day 1 Thursday:</b> (Leave Sacramento early to Las Vegas, Nevada via Death Valley)<br> 
We had to reach Las Vegas by 6:00 PM. The journey via Death Valley is around 10 hours. We have around 2-3 hours for stops and other stuff to do in Death Valley.

<br>

<b>After reaching Vegas:</b> We had dinner with an old friend. Then we saw the Strip and other hotels like(Paris, Venetian, Bellagio (watched the fountains), Stratosphere) and Casino's and Club for the night. We took our time here and had fun. The trip was not about Vegas so we did not spend too much time in Vegas, it was kind of a stop for the night.<br>

<br>

<b>HOTEL in Las Vegas:</b> DoubleTree By Hilton <b>(20,000 Hilton Points)</b> + 4 Breakfast coupons as a Daimond Member.<br>
<b>Regular Cost of Hotel = $170 + $120 ($30 each for a Breakfast Coupon) = $290.</b><br>
I rate 1 Hilton Point as 0.5 cent, so a great deal. I actually got $1.45 for each point including the breakfast coupons.</p>

<b>Day 2, Friday:</b> As we have partied late last night, we needed some rest so we can wake up till 11:00 AM and leave hotel by 12:00 PM (Late Checkout for HHnonors Daimond). Though we woke up around 8:00 AM, had our Breakfast an again slept till 11:00 AM. We went to a casino again to waste some money. We then left for Zion National Park around 2:00 PM after having lunch. We reached Zion by 4:30 PM via our Hotel at Hurricane, Utah. We also checked with information desk about the places we can see there. We reached late but still saw few things and did a bus trip of the park and spotted the few good places for next day hikes and also saw the sunset. We also did a small hike for around 30 minutes round trip and returned back to the parking by the last bus which was around 8:30 PM. Then we headed back to our hotel which was 20 - 30 min away from Zion National Park (The cheapest, closest and best place I could find).

<b>Hotel in Zion : Rodeway INN ( 97$ after 25$OFF (got a deal))</b>
                
<br><br>
<b>Day 3, Saturday (Day fully dedicated to Zion):</b> Our motto was to rest properly last night and leave early for the park for a full day adventure. We had our breakfast at the Hotel (was Below average as compared to Hilton). We also got some food to go for our lunch.<br>
We reached the park around 8:00 and it took us half an hour to reach our stop for the first hike. We started with <b>Angel's Landing</b>. By far the hardest hikes I have done. I would rate it 2nd toughest hike in USA after Half Dome. It was a tough hike; really tough for last half mile. But the view from the top was so awesome that the hike was worth it. The hike was very strenous. We were back at the bus stop by 1:00 PM. <br>

So we had our lunch after the hike. Our next hike was Lower Emerald Pool. It was a 1 hour round trip. The hike was really easy. <br>

Our third and the last hike for the day was The Narrows (Walking by the River). We did not finish the hike as it was a really long hike. We walked for a couple of miles along he river and then headed back to the stop.
<br>
By the time we reached our car, it was already 8 PM, so we started for Page, Arizona. We had our dinner at Pizza Hut somewhere around the border of Utah and Arizona. We reached Page, Arizona around 11:30 PM. It was a really bad drive especialy around first 30 miles from Zion especially at night. I try to drive during evenings/nights because it gives me the day to watch the beautiful things around me. We stayed in our hotel in Page, AZ so that we don't waste time in traveling next morning. The drive from Zion to Page was around 1.5 - 2 hours but it took us more time because of the dinner.<br><br>

 


<b>Good Places to see in Zion:</b> Emerald Pools, Weeping Rock, Angel's Landing (Best), Canyon Overlook, The Narrows and Riverside walk and more.<br><br>

<b>Hotel in Page:</b> Quality Inn At Lake Powell (97$)<br><br>

<b>Day 4, Sunday (Day fully dedicated to Page):</b> Page is a really beautiful place and we had our hotel in really good and beautiful location, we had a really great view from our window. It was a 7 min drive from <b>Horse Shoe Bend</b>, 15 min from <b>Antelope Canyon</b>, 5 min from <b>Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam</b>. We had our breakfast at Hotel. Breakfast was Good; somewhere between Hilton and Rodeway Inn.<br>

<br>

So we started with Horse Shoe bend and we spent like 2 hours exploring it and taking pictures. Then after fully exploring the beautiful Horse Shoe bend we headed to Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam. It is a good place to see and if you have enough time, you can go a boat ride or dam tour or any other tour offered there. We stayed there around 1.5 hours and then went to Lower Antelope Canyons.<br>

    <div class="lower">
        Lower Antelope Canyons, Page (Arizona).

</center>
<br>

<b>Lower Antelope Canyons</b> was the best spot to see in Page. I will rate it as one of the top spots in US. We had to take a guided tour to see the Lower Antelope Canyons. The price for guided tour was $33 per person. It was worth it. <b>As suggested by the guide, I would recommend to go for the first tour in the morning as it is the best time to see the canyons. Be sure to ask your guide to update our camera settings for better pictures. Try to stay with your guide as he will show you some awesome spots to take your best pictures. All the guides are really nice and love their jobs. The place is managed by Native Americans so they take pride in showing up their heritage. The guides are so nice that you will be more than happy to tip them.</b> The tour was around 1.5 hours. We really loved the tour. We finished our tour by 3:30 PM and then headed towards Grand Canyon.<br>

<br>

We reached Grand Canyon by 6:00 PM and saw 2-3 spots and also saw the sunset. Then we headed to our hotel around 7:30 PM which was in Flagstaff, Arizon around 1.5 hours drive from the Grand Canyon National Park. I did not realize that I was booking the hotel so far away from Grand Canyon. We reached Flagstaff by 9:00 PM, had dinner at a really good Indian restaurant. Then we headed to our hotel and had a good sleep.<br>

<br>

<b>Hotel in Flagstaff:</b> Baymont Inn and Suites ($61).<br><br>

<b>Day 5, Monday:</b> Frankly we had to leave back to Sacramento today just because of me, because I had my presentation Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM ( nothing else) so it was be fine for us if we reached late and my other four friends had nothing next day. Our plan for Monday was to start early for Grand Canyon and see few good spots within 6 hours we have and then head back home. There are three bus routes in Grand Canyon, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm">you can get details on their website</a>. We had a 2 mile hike named <b>Billion years hike</b> overlooking the beautiful canyons around the even gorgeous Colorado River.<br>



We then headed to the Red Line Bus (the bus with the most beautiful stops). We stopped at around 3-4 points which were Hopi Point, Pima Point, and the last stop on red line: Hermits Rest.

</center>
<br>

We then had our lunch in a closeby Subway and Carl's Junior and then headed back for Sacramento at around 3:00 PM. The drive from Grand Canyon to Sacramento with rest/pit stops was around 13-14 hours. This was the worst point of our trip as we had to leave all the fun to go back to school and drive so much to reach back there on time. We had three pit stops while coming back including one for dinner at McDonalds near Bakersfield,CA. We reached Sacramento around 4:30 AM. I slept for few hours and then went to school for my Project presentation.<br><br>


This trip was amazing and by far the best Spring trip I ever had. I hope we had more time to explore things more but as students we had our schedules really tight. I hope this may inspire many students/people to go for a trip this Spring Break. To all my fellow students I would suggest you guys to really enjoy these 4 years of your school and do travel and do some roadtrips. You will never get such a time again.

<h4>Few Tips:</h4>
<li>All the hotels I booked were refundable, so no worries but if in case we wanted to cancel any hotel. Always try to book hotels that are refundable.</li>
<li>Breakfast is free in every hotel and you should compulsory try to have it. It saves a lot of your money.</li>
<li>Personally I feel driving at night or late evening saves time if you have a tight schedule. But if you don't like to drive at night, try to avoid it.</li>
<li><b>Use Chase Sapphire Reserve</b>, I could not use it for this trip because there was no CSR at that time so I used Chase Sapphire Preferred.</li>
