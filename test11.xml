  As Spring break is arriving in couple of weeks, I just want to post my last year's Spring Break road trip report which spanned across California, Nevada, Utah and Arizona. It was one of the best road trips I ever had. I called this trip <b>The Four States</b> as I was with my 4 other friends and we travelled across 4 different states. Here is the complete detail of my trip which may help you in planning your trip in future.</p>

<br>

<b>Day 1 Thursday:</b> (Leave Sacramento early to Las Vegas, Nevada via Death Valley)<br> 
We had to reach Las Vegas by 6:00 PM. The journey via Death Valley is around 10 hours. We have around 2-3 hours for stops and other stuff to do in Death Valley.

<br>

<b>After reaching Vegas:</b> We had dinner with an old friend. Then we saw the Strip and other hotels like(Paris, Venetian, Bellagio (watched the fountains), Stratosphere) and Casino's and Club for the night. We took our time here and had fun. The trip was not about Vegas so we did not spend too much time in Vegas, it was kind of a stop for the night.<br>

<br>

<b>HOTEL in Las Vegas:</b> DoubleTree By Hilton <b>(20,000 Hilton Points)</b> + 4 Breakfast coupons as a Daimond Member.<br>
<b>Regular Cost of Hotel = $170 + $120 ($30 each for a Breakfast Coupon) = $290.</b><br>
I rate 1 Hilton Point as 0.5 cent, so a great deal. I actually got $1.45 for each point including the breakfast coupons.</p>

<p>
<b>Day 2, Friday:</b> As we have partied late last night, we needed some rest so we can wake up till 11:00 AM and leave hotel by 12:00 PM (Late Checkout for HHnonors Daimond). Though we woke up around 8:00 AM, had our Breakfast an again slept till 11:00 AM. We went to a casino again to waste some money. We then left for Zion National Park around 2:00 PM after having lunch. We reached Zion by 4:30 PM via our Hotel at Hurricane, Utah. We also checked with information desk about the places we can see there. We reached late but still saw few things and did a bus trip of the park and spotted the few good places for next day hikes and also saw the sunset. We also did a small hike for around 30 minutes round trip and returned back to the parking by the last bus which was around 8:30 PM. Then we headed back to our hotel which was 20 - 30 min away from Zion National Park (The cheapest, closest and best place I could find).

<b>Hotel in Zion : Rodeway INN ( 97$ after 25$OFF (got a deal))</b>
                
<br><br>
<b>Day 3, Saturday (Day fully dedicated to Zion):</b> Our motto was to rest properly last night and leave early for the park for a full day adventure. We had our breakfast at the Hotel (was Below average as compared to Hilton). We also got some food to go for our lunch.<br>
We reached the park around 8:00 and it took us half an hour to reach our stop for the first hike. We started with <b>Angel's Landing</b>. By far the hardest hikes I have done. I would rate it 2nd toughest hike in USA after Half Dome. It was a tough hike; really tough for last half mile. But the view from the top was so awesome that the hike was worth it. The hike was very strenous. We were back at the bus stop by 1:00 PM. <br>

So we had our lunch after the hike. Our next hike was Lower Emerald Pool. It was a 1 hour round trip. The hike was really easy. <br>

Our third and the last hike for the day was The Narrows (Walking by the River). We did not finish the hike as it was a really long hike. We walked for a couple of miles along he river and then headed back to the stop.
<br>
By the time we reached our car, it was already 8 PM, so we started for Page, Arizona. We had our dinner at Pizza Hut somewhere around the border of Utah and Arizona. We reached Page, Arizona around 11:30 PM. It was a really bad drive especialy around first 30 miles from Zion especially at night. I try to drive during evenings/nights because it gives me the day to watch the beautiful things around me. We stayed in our hotel in Page, AZ so that we don't waste time in traveling next morning. The drive from Zion to Page was around 1.5 - 2 hours but it took us more time because of the dinner.<br><br>

 


<b>Good Places to see in Zion:</b> Emerald Pools, Weeping Rock, Angel's Landing (Best), Canyon Overlook, The Narrows and Riverside walk and more.<br><br>

<b>Hotel in Page:</b> Quality Inn At Lake Powell (97$)<br><br>

<b>Day 4, Sunday (Day fully dedicated to Page):</b> Page is a really beautiful place and we had our hotel in really good and beautiful location, we had a really great view from our window. It was a 7 min drive from <b>Horse Shoe Bend</b>, 15 min from <b>Antelope Canyon</b>, 5 min from <b>Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam</b>. We had our breakfast at Hotel. Breakfast was Good; somewhere between Hilton and Rodeway Inn.<br>

<br>

So we started with Horse Shoe bend and we spent like 2 hours exploring it and taking pictures. Then after fully exploring the beautiful Horse Shoe bend we headed to Lake Powell and Glen Canyon Dam. It is a good place to see and if you have enough time, you can go a boat ride or dam tour or any other tour offered there. We stayed there around 1.5 hours and then went to Lower Antelope Canyons.<br>

    <div class="lower">
        Lower Antelope Canyons, Page (Arizona).
    </div>
</center>
<br>

<b>Lower Antelope Canyons</b> was the best spot to see in Page. I will rate it as one of the top spots in US. We had to take a guided tour to see the Lower Antelope Canyons. The price for guided tour was $33 per person. It was worth it. <b>As suggested by the guide, I would recommend to go for the first tour in the morning as it is the best time to see the canyons. Be sure to ask your guide to update our camera settings for better pictures. Try to stay with your guide as he will show you some awesome spots to take your best pictures. All the guides are really nice and love their jobs. The place is managed by Native Americans so they take pride in showing up their heritage. The guides are so nice that you will be more than happy to tip them.</b> The tour was around 1.5 hours. We really loved the tour. We finished our tour by 3:30 PM and then headed towards Grand Canyon.<br>

<br>

We reached Grand Canyon by 6:00 PM and saw 2-3 spots and also saw the sunset. Then we headed to our hotel around 7:30 PM which was in Flagstaff, Arizon around 1.5 hours drive from the Grand Canyon National Park. I did not realize that I was booking the hotel so far away from Grand Canyon. We reached Flagstaff by 9:00 PM, had dinner at a really good Indian restaurant. Then we headed to our hotel and had a good sleep.<br>

</center>
<br>

<b>Hotel in Flagstaff:</b> Baymont Inn and Suites ($61).<br><br>

<b>Day 5, Monday:</b> Frankly we had to leave back to Sacramento today just because of me, because I had my presentation Tuesday morning at 9:00 AM ( nothing else) so it was be fine for us if we reached late and my other four friends had nothing next day. Our plan for Monday was to start early for Grand Canyon and see few good spots within 6 hours we have and then head back home. There are three bus routes in Grand Canyon, <a href="https://www.nps.gov/grca/index.htm">you can get details on their website</a>. We had a 2 mile hike named <b>Billion years hike</b> overlooking the beautiful canyons around the even gorgeous Colorado River.<br>



We then headed to the Red Line Bus (the bus with the most beautiful stops). We stopped at around 3-4 points which were Hopi Point, Pima Point, and the last stop on red line: Hermits Rest.

    </div>
</center>
<br>

We then had our lunch in a closeby Subway and Carl's Junior and then headed back for Sacramento at around 3:00 PM. The drive from Grand Canyon to Sacramento with rest/pit stops was around 13-14 hours. This was the worst point of our trip as we had to leave all the fun to go back to school and drive so much to reach back there on time. We had three pit stops while coming back including one for dinner at McDonalds near Bakersfield,CA. We reached Sacramento around 4:30 AM. I slept for few hours and then went to school for my Project presentation.<br><br>


This trip was amazing and by far the best Spring trip I ever had. I hope we had more time to explore things more but as students we had our schedules really tight. I hope this may inspire many students/people to go for a trip this Spring Break. To all my fellow students I would suggest you guys to really enjoy these 4 years of your school and do travel and do some roadtrips. You will never get such a time again.

<h4>Few Tips:</h4>
<li>All the hotels I booked were refundable, so no worries but if in case we wanted to cancel any hotel. Always try to book hotels that are refundable.</li>
<li>Breakfast is free in every hotel and you should compulsory try to have it. It saves a lot of your money.</li>
<li>Personally I feel driving at night or late evening saves time if you have a tight schedule. But if you don't like to drive at night, try to avoid it.</li>
<li><b>Use Chase Sapphire Reserve</b>, I could not use it for this trip becaus ethere was no CSR at that time I use Chase Sapphire Preferred.</li>

<p>I got an email from American Express in which they are offering 5,000 extra Starpoints after you spend $5,000 in qualifying purchases on your enrolled Starwood Preferred Guest® Credit Card from American Express between the time you complete enrollment and <b>May 31, 2017.</b> Enrollment period ends on <b>March 31, 2017.</b></p>

<br>
<h3><b>My Verdict:</b></h3>
<p> At first I thought they extended me this offer as my annual fee is due in few days but many people have recieved this offer. In my opinion this a great offer to earn 5,000 extra points on spend of $5,000; which will at least earn you 10,000 Starwood Points (5,000 at least on spending $5,000 + 5,000 bonus).</p>]]></content:encoded>

<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><b>Why do student need Credit Cards?</b></h4>
<p>Your credit score can impact your ability to rent an apartment, take a car loan or a student loan. The better credit score you have the better interest rates you will get for your loans. That's why building credit from an early age is important and what's better than starting as a college student. 
<br>
If you want to get started with credit while you're in college, a student credit card is what you should be looking for. You can get a Student credit card or a normal credit depending on your credit history.</p>

<br>

    <div class="lower">
        Great no annual fee cards.
    </div>
</center>
<br>

<br>
<h4><b>How do I rank a Credit cards for Students?</b></h4>
<p>The first assumption I make is assuming a no-credit history or very limited credit history. Almost all the cards for students have same benefits but there are few things which make them unique and easy to get approve:
<ul>
  <li><b>Annual Fee</b>: I would recommend to get a no annual fee card; as a student you don't need to pay for any unwanted fee. I have not included any card with an annual fee.</li>
  <li><b>Rewards:</b> One of the main reasons of getting credit cards is for its rewards and this is one main reasons to differentiate among cards. Your'e cards can reward you with cashback or points on eligibe purchases.</li>
  <li><b>APR (Introductory APR):</b> APR is the interest that you pay if you don't pay your credit card balance in full at the end of your statement. There are many credit cards that offer you 0% Introductory APR for first 12-21 months. </li>
  <li><b>Acceptance Rate:</b> Most college students have limited experience with credit history and with credit cards, so acceptance rate matters for students. There is no real number for acceptance rates, but from data points and customer interactions we get to know that which cards are easier to get. Chase cards are hard to get as your first credit card but BOFA, Capital One and Discover cards are really easy to get even without any credit history.</li>
  <li><b>Sign up bonus:</b> Sign up bonuses are bonus offers when you get as a welcome gift for applying and getting approved for the credit card.</li>

</ul></p>

<h3>Seven of the best Credit Cards:</h3>

  <li><b><a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cash-back/it-card.html">Discover it® for Student cards</a></b></li>

<p>With American Express making changes to its Platinum Card now makes all the top three high end credit card companies to make changes to its top product in the last 1 year. Today I am trying to evaluate which one is the best card among the best.

<br>

<br>

<h4><b>Annual Fee vs Earning?</b></h4>
<p>The annual fees of the top cards is $450 for CSR and Prestige whereas annual fee of Platinum has been increased to $550. All three cards have different bonus categories.</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <thead class="thead">
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th><center>Chase Sapphire Reserve</center></th>
      <th><center>AMEX Platinum Card</center></th>
      <th><center>Citi Prestige</center></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Annual Fee</th>
      <td><center>$450</center></td>
      <td><center>$550</center></td>
      <td><center>$450</center></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Airfare & Hotels</th>
      <td><center>3x (Includes all travel purchases)</center></td>
      <td><center>5x (purchased through airlines/ Amex portal)</center></td>

    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Dining</th>

      <td><center>1x</center></td>
      <td><center>1x</center></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>I believe CSR has the best bonus earning ratios among all three cards pre-dominantly because of its 3x points on travel (includes hotels, public transport, flights, car rentals, Uber/Lyft and more) and dining. Though CSR has one more unique feature of linking with <b>Chase Freedom Unlimited</b>, which gives 1.5 points on all the purchases.<br>AMEX Platinum has a nice 5x of Airfare and Hotels but that should be purchased directly with airlines or from the AMEX travel portal which I believe is rubbish as there are very few people who book flights/hotels directly through their websites. AMEX also have a disadvantage on having $550 as their annual fee(which they changed recently).<br>Citi almost have the same rewards like CSR but have 2x on dining though they 2x on entertainment purchases as well.</p>

<h4><b>Sign Up Bonus, APR and Additional Card Fee</b></h4>
<p>Sign up bonuses are a big factor for choosing the best cards. AMEX Platinum and Citi Prestige have always been on the slow side here. Though we sometimes see huge sign up bouses for Platinum cards but its very rare. CSR had 100,000 points offer till January 12,2017 and still has it in branch till Mar 12,2017. </p>

<h4><b>Annual Travel Credit and Lounge Pass</b></h4>
<p>The high end credit card gives some huge perks on travel. <b>CSR</b> offers $300 travel credit which can be redeemed for any travel purchase. Amex Platinum and Citi Prestige offers $200 and $250 in Airline fee credit which can be redeemed in anything purchased directly with airlines you choose or <a href="post6">Check this way to redeem it.</a> Amex Platinum now also offers $200 in Uber Credits ($15/month and $20 at the end of the year), which is good for someone who uses Uber a lot. But I am afraid, people having Amex Platinum Card uses Uber that often unless they live in big city like San Francisco or New York.</p>

<h3><b>Conclusion:</b></h3>
<p>At last, it all depends on what categories you spend most. Analysing all the feautures and benefits of the three cards, I believe best high end credit card will be <b>Chase Sapphire Reserve</b> for regular users. Mostly because of its $300 travel credit, which brings the annual fee to almost $150. <b>Also having Chase Freedom Unlimited with CSR will make it the best card available.</b> <br>Although American Express have made some great changes to Platinum Card which brings it close enough to CSR. But their 5x bonus on airfare is rubbish as there are very few people who book flights directly through airlines. I also believe that Citi Prestige is far away from the race of the best as to compete with Chase and AMEX, Citi has to make some big changes to its card.</p>

<h3>My Verdict:</h3>
<p>It is a great deal as it gives us a chance to rack up around 25,000 Ultimate Rewards or $250 in cashback. However it is not easy to use the offer to the fullest unless you are planning for a trip. This offer gives a 7% extra cashback than Chase Sapphire Reserve.</p>]]></content:encoded>
