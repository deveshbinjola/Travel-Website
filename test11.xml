<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4><b>Why do student need Credit Cards?</b></h4>
<p>Your credit score can impact your ability to rent an apartment, take a car loan or a student loan. The better credit score you have the better interest rates you will get for your loans. That's why building credit from an early age is important and what's better than starting as a college student. 
<br>
If you want to get started with credit while you're in college, a student credit card is what you should be looking for. You can get a Student credit card or a normal credit depending on your credit history.</p>

<br>
<h4><b>How do I rank a Credit cards for Students?</b></h4>
<p>The first assumption I make is assuming a no-credit history or very limited credit history. Almost all the cards for students have same benefits but there are few things which make them unique and easy to get approve:
<ul>
  <li><b>Annual Fee</b>: I would recommend to get a no annual fee card; as a student you don't need to pay for any unwanted fee. I have not included any card with an annual fee.</li>
  <li><b>Rewards:</b> One of the main reasons of getting credit cards is for its rewards and this is one main reasons to differentiate among cards. Your'e cards can reward you with cashback or points on eligibe purchases.</li>
  <li><b>APR (Introductory APR):</b> APR is the interest that you pay if you don't pay your credit card balance in full at the end of your statement. There are many credit cards that offer you 0% Introductory APR for first 12-21 months. </li>
  <li><b>Acceptance Rate:</b> Most college students have limited experience with credit history and with credit cards, so acceptance rate matters for students. There is no real number for acceptance rates, but from data points and customer interactions we get to know that which cards are easier to get. Chase cards are hard to get as your first credit card but BOFA, Capital One and Discover cards are really easy to get even without any credit history.</li>
  <li><b>Sign up bonus:</b> Sign up bonuses are bonus offers when you get as a welcome gift for applying and getting approved for the credit card.</li>

</ul></p>

<h3><b>My Verdict:</b></h3>
<p>The best card for a student or someone with no credit history at all is <b><a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cash-back/it-card.html">Discover It Card</a></b>. If you have any kind of history, you should surely go with <b><a href="https://applynow.chase.com/FlexAppWeb/renderApp.do?SPID=FMLQ&CELL=63HC&MSC=1523617955">Chase Freedom Unlimited</a></b>.

<p>With American Express making changes to its Platinum Card now makes all the top three high end credit card companies to make changes to its top product in the last 1 year. Today I am trying to evaluate which one is the best card among the best.

<br>
<h4><b>Which cards are being evaluated?</b></h4>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-reserve?CELL=6TKX">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/platinum/25330?linknav=US-Acq-CCSG-Cardmember-VAC-Platinum-ViewCardDetails">Platinum Card by American Express</a></li>

    </div>
</center>
<br>

<h4><b>Annual Fee vs Earning?</b></h4>
<p>The annual fees of the top cards is $450 for CSR and Prestige whereas annual fee of Platinum has been increased to $550. All three cards have different bonus categories.</p>
<table class="table table-striped">
  <thead class="thead">
    <tr>
      <th></th>
      <th><center>Chase Sapphire Reserve</center></th>
      <th><center>AMEX Platinum Card</center></th>
      <th><center>Citi Prestige</center></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Annual Fee</th>
      <td><center>$450</center></td>
      <td><center>$550</center></td>
      <td><center>$450</center></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Airfare & Hotels</th>
      <td><center>3x (Includes all travel purchases)</center></td>
      <td><center>5x (purchased through airlines/ Amex portal)</center></td>
      <td><center>3x (Includes all travel purchases)</center></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Dining</th>
      <td><center>3x</center></td>
      <td><center>1x</center></td>
      <td><center>2x</center></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Entertainment</th>
      <td><center>1x</center></td>
      <td><center>1x</center></td>
      <td><center>2x</center></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Others</th>
      <td><center>1x (1.5x with Freedom Unlimited)</center></td>
      <td><center>1x</center></td>
      <td><center>1x</center></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>I believe CSR has the best bonus earning ratios among all three cards pre-dominantly because of its 3x points on travel (includes hotels, public transport, flights, car rentals, Uber/Lyft and more) and dining. Though CSR has one more unique feature of linking with <b>Chase Freedom Unlimited</b>, which gives 1.5 points on all the purchases.<br>AMEX Platinum has a nice 5x of Airfare and Hotels but that should be purchased directly with airlines or from the AMEX travel portal. AMEX also have a disadvantage on having $550 as their annual fee(which they changed recently).<br>Citi almost have the same rewards like CSR but have 2x on dining though they 2x on entertainment purchases as well.</p>

<h4><b>Sign Up Bonus, APR and Additional Card Fee</b></h4>
<p>Sign up bonuses are a big factor for choosing the best cards. AMEX Platinum and Citi Prestige have always been on the slow side here. Though we sometimes see huge sign up bouses for Platinum cards but its very rare. CSR had 100,000 points offer till January 12,2017 and still has it in branch till Mar 12,2017. </p>

<h3><b>Conclusion:</b></h3>
<p>At last, it all depends on what categories you spend most. Analysing all the feautures and benefits of the three cards, I believe best high end credit card will be <b>Chase Sapphire Reserve</b> for regular users. Mostly because of its $300 travel credit, which brings the annual fee to almost $150. <b>Also having Chase Freedom Unlimited with CSR will make it the best card available.</b> <br>Although American Express have made some great changes to Platinum Card which brings it close enough to CSR. I also believe that Citi Prestige is far away from the race of the best as to compete with Chase and AMEX, Citi has to make some big changes to its card.</p>

 <p><b>Winner:</b> Chase Sapphire Reserve </p>
 <p><b>Runner Up:</b> AMEX Platinum Card</p>]]></content:encoded>

        Great offer on a no annual fee card.

<h3>My Verdict:</h3>
<p>It is a great deal as it gives us a chance to rack up around 25,000 Ultimate Rewards or $250 in cashback. However it is not easy to use the offer to the fullest unless you are planning for a trip. This offer gives a 7% extra cashback than Chase Sapphire Reserve.</p>]]></content:encoded>

  <p> It is a great offer, I don't know specifically which places it works in, it says it will work in flood affected areas in San Jose but it works in Sacramento aswell. It is a great offer as you can save upto $50.</p>
