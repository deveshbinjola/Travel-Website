            <p>The main thing to keep in mind while getting your first credit card is to get a card with <b>no annual fee</b>. So that way you can keep that forever. It will help you in your credit history in future. 
<br>Top 5 cards I would recomment you to apply as your first credit card.</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href= "#">Chase Freedom/ Freedom Unlimited</a></li>
  <li><a href= "#"> Citi Thank You Rewards Card for Students </a></li>
  <li><a href= "#">Bank of America Better Balance Card</a></li>
  <li><a href= "#">Bank of America Cash Rewards Card</a></li>
  <li><a href= "#">Discover it for Students</a></li>
</ol>

<p><b>The best cards to get easily acceptable are:</b></p>
<ol> 
<li><a href= "#">Bank of America Better Balance Card</a></li> 
<li><a href= "#">Bank of America Cash Rewards Card</a></li> 
<li><a href= "#">Discover it for Students</a></li>
<li><a href= "#">Capital One Journey Student Rewards</a></li>
<li><a href= "#"> Citi Thank You Rewards Card for Students </a></li> </ol>


<p>Chase does have some restrictions to give cards to people with no credit or bad credit. They do accept but these cards have the better acceptance rate than the Chase ones.<b> So if you have low credit history or no credit history, go for these cards instead.</b></p>
     
<p><b>My First Credit Card was <a href= "#">Bank of America Cash Rewards Card</a> which I got on the day I got my SSN.</b> I still have that card with me and it has been useful in many ways for me.</p>

 
<div class="page-header" id="gallery">
  <h2>How to apply for a Credit Card?<small> Simple tips to boost your acceptance rate.</small></h2>
</div>
  <ol>
    <li><b>Try to apply in a bank where you already have an account.</b> I would suggest everyone applying for their first credit card to apply in a bank they already have a Checking/Savings account. This way you already have a relationship with the bank and your chances to get approved are more.</li><br>

    <li><b>Always put your Rent to be zero</b> even if you rent a house. As a student, you get some help from your parents and bank loans to get pay your rent so claiming your rent to be zero gives you more spending power. Here is an example of a credit card application.<br><br></li><img src="Image/applytip1.png" class="img-responsive"><br><br>

    <li><b>You should include all your incomes.</b> Any incomes coming from scholarships or any other way shoud be included in your total income. in order to boost up your acceptance chances.</li><br>

    <li><b>Dont Give up just yet.</b> You can call the reconsideration lines to ask them reason of your rejection and even to reconsider you for the card. <a href ="reconsider">Here is a list of the reconsideration numbers of major credit card issuers.</a> Another thing with the reconsideration lines is it depends on the person you are talking to; you can try calling them again. Sometimes it all depends on the person and on his/her mood whom you are talking to. So don't hesitate to call again.</li><br>
    <li><b>Apply in-person.</b> This might be your last resort as sometimes the chances of credit card approvals are more if you apply in-person. Try applying in a bank in which you already have your account.</li>
  </ol>

<p>I believe these tips will help your get your first card easily. I got mine accepted the very first day I got my SSN without any credit history. So I feel that if you apply it the right way, you shuld get it easily. If you still did not get a credit card because of a bad credit history or you are too young to get one. <b>You can become an authorized user on your Parents credit card or your siblings card or someone you know who might add you.</b> I will advice parents to add their children as an authorized user if you think that they are not so much interested in all these stuff. And that way you can also monitor his/her spending.</p>


<div class="page-header" id="gallery">
  <h2>Things to keep in mind after you get your First Credit Card.</h2>
</div>
  <ol>
  <li><b>Always pay your balances in full and regularly.</b> I would advice you to treat your credit card as a debit card. You might think what is he saying. Yes, the main reason people do bad in credit is because they lend too much. One should not spend more 30% of his credit limit. The lesse the better. If you have limit of 10000$, try to spend around or less than 3000$ every month. You spend more and have less credit limit, you can pay off your balance leaving around 30% before the bank generates the credit card statement. This way you can gather some points and still build your credit history. People with Excellent credit history spend around 5% of their credit limit.</li>

<center><img src="Image/creditscore2.png" class="img-responsive" ></center><br>

  <li><b>Regularly check your Credit Score.</b> Regularly checking your credit score will keep you in sync with your credit history. As you are building your credit, you should know the impact of the different things on your credit score.<br>Many credit card companies like American Express, Discover and CITI Bank tells you your Credit score every month. There are many sites which help you find your credit score for free. You can check your credit score on these website just by signing up and telling them your last 4 digits of SSN No. Here are websites which tell your credit score for free.<ol>
    <li><a href ="#">Credit Karma</a></li>
    <li><a href ="#">Credit Sesame</a></li>
    <li><a href ="#">Quizzle</a></li>
  </ol> </li>

<center><img src="Image/creditscore1.png" class="img-responsive"></center><br>

  <li><b>Try to shop with this card.</b> I will always use my credit card for everything. That's what we should do, we get rewards to use our credit card. Try using your card but if you have small credit limit, try to be in reach with 30% or come back home pay off if you spend more than 30%. Regular payments increases your credit history.</li><br>


   <li><b>Earn Rewards.</b> By using the card everywhere you can earn different types of rewards. <a href ="#">Take a look on the diffrent types rewards of different cards.</a></li>
