<p>A credit card allows us to make a purchase and allows us to pay over time. Then there are more things to it APR, Balance Transfers and all. But we are not dealing with all this.<b> The most important thing using a credit card is to pay the balance in full every month; if you can't do I won't suggest to use credit cards.</b> We try to use credit cards for other benefits that people doesn't even know about. Here is a list of different credit cards od different types and I explain the benefits, try applying foe ones that best suits your requirements and needs. <b>One thing I suggest people is to go for credit cards with points instead of cashback, I'll explain why when you read further.</b> The 4 different types of credit cards are:</p>
<ol>
  
  <h4><li><b><a href="airline">Airline Credit Card</a></b><br></li></h4>
  <p>
  Airline Credit Cards are offered from Airlines with credit card issuers. These cards offer a signup bonus ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 miles. These miles can only be used for the airline the card is issued for. The card also offers extra benefits like: <ol>
    <li>Free Check-in baggage for upto a family of 4.</li>
    <li>Priority Boarding (Faster boarding).</li>
    <li>Some airlines like Alaska Airlines and Southwest offer a <a href ="#">companion pass</a>.</li>
    <li>These cards also offer VIP Status (Gold, Silver, etc.) for the Airlines loyalty programs which have many other benefits.</li>
    <li>You can check my list of miles valuations here. This might give you heads up which ones are the best for you.</li>
    <li>Most of the cards also offer <b>No Foriegn Transaction Fee</b>.</li>
    <li>There is a annual fee for most of the cards but check out my post to see if that is worth it or not.</li>
  </ol></p>
  
  <h4><li><b><a href="cashback">Cashback Credit Card</a></b><br></li></h4>
  <p>
    Cashback Cards are offered from credit card issuers which offer cashback on different categories ranging from 1% to 5%. These cards are good for people who don't like to travel and want to have some cash from their credit cards. I don't feel like that cashback cards are of ay good use though they good cashback deals. But there are some of the cashback credit cards which can be combined with other points credit cards which make a whole lot of sense. 
  </p>

  <h4><li><b><a href="hotel">Hotel Points</a></b><br></li></h4>
  <p>
    Hotel Credit Cards are offered from Hotels with credit card issuers. These cards offer a signup bonus ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 miles. These points can only be used for the hotel chains the card is issued for. The card also offers extra benefits like:
    <ol>
    <li>Early Check-ins and Late Check-outs.</li>
    <li>Many cards like IHG, Mariott, Ritz Carlton and more offer a <a href ="#"> free night every year</a>.</li>
    <li>These cards also offer VIP Status (Gold, Platinum, Diamond, etc.) for the Hotel loyalty programs which have many other benefits.<a href="hiltondiamond"> Check out my review of Hilton Diamond Status.</a></li>
    <li>You can check my list of hotel points valuations here. This might give you heads up which ones are the best for you.</li>
    <li>Most of the cards also offer <b>No Foriegn Transaction Fee</b>.</li>
    <li>There is a annual fee for most of the cards but most of these cards offer a free night which mostly justifies the annual fee but <b>many cards offer great sign up bonuses without any annual fee</b>.</li>
  </ol>
  </p>

  <h4><li><b><a href="points">Other Points</a></b><br></li></h4>
  <p>
    These are easily the best type of credit cards for any who wants to travel at a cheaper price. These cards offer a signup bonus ranging from 30,000 to 100,000 miles. The card also offers extra benefits like:
    <ol>
      <li>These points can be used for different hotels and airlines according to the transfer partners of the credit card issuers.</li>
      <li>There are many options to use your points as airline miles and hotel points.</li>
      <li>You can also use points on Amazon, paying your credit card and many more things. But using it as miles is the best option.</li>
      <li>You can check my list of points valuations here. This might give you heads up which ones are the best for you.</li>
      <li>Almost all the cards also offer <b>No Foriegn Transaction Fee</b>.</li>
    </ol>

  <ol>

    <h4><li><a href="#">Chase Sapphire Reserve</a></li></h4>
    <p>
      <b>My views: </b>This is the best travel credit card available in the market. The $450 annual fee is actually worth only $150. I use it for almost everything regarding travel and in any restaurants.

      </ol>
    </p>


     <h4><li><a href="#">Chase Sapphire Preferred</a></li></h4>
    <p>
      <b>My views: </b>This is one of the best travel credit card available in the market for not too much annual fee. It's 2x points on travel and restaurants is really great as we can transfer these points to 7 different airlines and 4 different hotel chains. It's metal made look also makes it classy and better than other cards. The points earned on this card are called Ultimate Rewards.

     <h4><li><a href="#">Starwood Preferred Guest</a></li></h4>
    <p>
      <b>My views: </b>One of the other cards that I really like to use because of its transfer points. I use it for almost everything except travel and in any restaurants for which I use my Chase Sapphire Preferred. We can transfer Starpoints to over 30 airline frequent flyer programs, mostly on a one-to-one basis. Receive a 5,000 Starpoint bonus when you transfer 20,000 Starpoints to a participating frequent flyer program. You can also book really amazing Starwood hotels with these points.
      <br><b>Annual Fee: </b>$0 Intro Annual Fee for the first year, then $95.

    </p>
     <h4><li><a href="#">Chase IHG Rewards Card</a></li></h4>
    <p>
      <b>My views: </b>This card is 3rd on my list because it offers a free annual night on any IHG hotel (choose among 4,800 hotels). Unlike other hotel cards there is no category restrictions. You can book a night at Intercontinental, Bora Bora or Venettian, Las Vegas as a part free annual fee. The sign up bonus is good too. I feel this card is too keep as it clearly justifies its annual fee with lots of benefit.
      <br><b>Annual Fee: </b>$0 Intro Annual Fee for the first year, then $49.
      <br><b>Benefits: </b><ol>
        <li>Recieve Sign up Bonus: 60,000 Points + $50 Statement Credit. <a href="#"> Lear how to get 20,00 Points instead of $50.</a></li>

    <h4><li><a href="#">Citi Premier Card</a></li></h4>
     <p>
      <b>My views: </b>I feel this card is almost same as Chase Sapphire Prefrred. There are a lot of benefits, which include bonus spending categories; 3 points on travel purchases and 2 points per dollar on dining and entertainment. We can transfer these points to 10 different airlines and 1 hotel chain.
      <br><b>Annual Fee: </b>$0 Intro Annual Fee for the first year, then $95.
      <br><b>Benefits: </b><ol>
        <li>The Sign up Bonus is currently zero. It used to be 50,000 few months back. I would suggest take apply for this card if the signup bonus is available.</li>
        <li>Earn 3 points per $1 on travel including Gas.</li>
        <li>ThankYou Points are worth 25% more when redeemed for airfare, hotels, cruises and car rentals through the ThankYou速 Travel Center, as compared to gift cards redeemed from the ThankYou Rewards collection.</li>

     <h4><li><a href="#">American Express Premier Gold Rewards Card</a></li></h4>
     <p>
      <b>My views: </b> This is a charge card from American Express, a charge card is a card in which you pay the balance in the end of the month. It earns Membership Rewards which can be transferred to 17 different airlines and 3 hotel chains.
      <br><b>Annual Fee: </b>$0 Intro Annual Fee for the first year, then $160.

     <h4><li><a href="#">Chase Ink Plus Business Card</a></li></h4>
     <p>
      <b>My views: </b> One of the best business cards with great sign up bonus. The 5x points on office supply is great for regular use and even for <a href="#"> manufactured spending</a>. You can also earn 2x points on gas station and hotel accomodation.
