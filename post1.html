   <h2>Must have Credit Cards in your arsenal. <SMALL>Best of the best.</SMALL></h2>
  </div>
  
<p>
  Now you can pay your rent through your credit card without any extra fees. RadPad has teamed up with Stripe to make it free. I believe it is free till the end of this year, So it is great time use it and earn some rewards.</p><br>

  <ol>
  <h4><li><b>Chase Sapphire Preferred</b></li></h4>
  <p>This is the best travel credit card available in the market. I use it for almost everything regarding travel and in any restaurants. It's 2x points on travel and restaurants is really great as we can transfer these points to 7 different airlines and 4 different hotel chains. It's metal made look also makes it classy and better than other cards. The points earned on this card are called Ultimate Rewards. <b>The annual fee is $95 from second year but the benefits this card provides easily outweigh the annual fee.</b></p>

  <h4><li><b>Chase Freedom Unlimited Credit Card</b></li></h4>
  <p>One of the must-have credit cards because of the no annual fee and can be used as a co-credit with Chase Sapphire Preferred. Points earned on the card can be used as cashback and Ultimate Rewards too (Using as Ultimate Rewards is a far better option). It earns 1.5% cashback on everything which is really great and it can be used with Sapphire. <b>The sign up bonus is 15,000 points or $150 and you get additional $25 or 2,500 points for adding an authorized user. The best thing is that there is no annual fee.</b></p>

  <h4><li><b>Chase Freedom Credit Card</b></li></h4>
  <p>One of the must-have credit cards because of the no annual fee and can be used as a co-credit with Chase Sapphire Preferred. Points earned on the card can be used as cashback and Ultimate Rewards too (Using as Ultimate Rewards is a far better option). It earns 5% cashback on different categories and is great for stacking up points and using with Sapphire. <b>The sign up bonus is 15,000 points or $150 and you get additional $25 or 2,500 points for adding an authorized user. The best thing is that there is no annual fee.</b></p>

   <h4><li><b>Chase IHG® Rewards Club Select Credit Card</b></li></h4>
  <p>One the annual fee hotel credit card on my list because it offers a free annual night on any IHG hotel (choose among 4,800 hotels). Unlike other hotel cards there is no category restrictions. You can book a night at Intercontinental, Bora Bora or Venettian, Las Vegas for redeeming the free annual night. The sign up bonus is good too varies around 60,000 - 80,000 points. <a href="#">You can compensate with Chase regarding the sign up bonus as well.</a><b> I feel this card is too keep as it clearly justifies its $49 annual fee with lots of benefit and the first year is free as well.</b></p>

  <h4><li><b>Amex EveryDay® Credit Card</b></li></h4>
  <p>A great card to have in your wallet as it earns Membership Reward points from American Express which are transferrable to 17 different airlines and 3 hotel chains. It earns 2 point per $1 spent on grocery and 1 point per $1 spent on everything else.<b> You get 20% bonus points if you do more than 20 transactions in a billing cycle. This is a no annual fee card as well and is a great card to keep for lifetime.</b></p>

  <h4><li><b>BankAmericard Better Balance Rewards</b></li></h4>
  <p>The only reason for me to keep this card is because it gives me <b>$30 ($25 + $5) every quarter</b> very easily. <a href="netflixfree.html">Check out how you can have your netflix membership for free for lifetime.</a> This card basically gives 25$ every quarter for paying your monthly balance in full or more than minimum payment, it also gives an additional $5 for having a BOFA Checking account. You can use it for <a href="netflixfree.html">Free Netflix</a>, reload Amazon gift cards with it or can get it in form of cashback all for a no annual fee.</p>

  <h4><li><b>Hilton HHonors Card from American Express</b></li></h4>
  <p><b>A great Hilton card from American Express which offers free Silver Status and a good sign up bonus for no annual fee.</b> I would recommend you to apply for this card when there is a good sign up bonus deal going on of around (70,000 or more Hilton Honors points).</p>

  <h4><li><b>Citi® Hilton HHonors Visa Signature® Card</b></li></h4>
  <p><b>Another great Hilton card from Citi which offers free Silver Status and a good sign up bonus for no annual fee.</b> I would recommend you to apply for this card right now because the signup bonus right now is 75,000 Hilton Honors points.</p>

  <p>The combination of these two cards gives you a free Gold Status and around 150,000 Hilton Honors points good for staying in Doubletree By Hilton in Las Vegas for 8 days and around 3 nights in other big Hilton property.</p>

<h3>I would not recommend these two cards to Students.</h3>

  <h4><li><b>Starwood Preferred Guest® Credit Card from American Express</b></li></h4>
  <p>One of the other cards that I really like to use because of its transfer points. I use it for almost everything except travel and in any restaurants for which I use my Chase Sapphire Preferred. We can transfer Starpoints to over 30 airline frequent flyer programs, mostly on a one-to-one basis. Receive a 5,000 Starpoint bonus when you transfer 20,000 Starpoints to a participating frequent flyer program. You can also book really amazing Starwood hotels with these points. Would not recommend students to keep it because it will be too much annual fees for you to pay.</p>

  <h4><li><b>Chase Ink Plus Business Card</b><small> Recommended for people going on business trips.</small></li></h4>
  <p>I feel it is the best credit card for people having business transactions or even if someone wants a business credit card. This card offers 5X points per $1 on the first $50,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on cellular phone, landline, internet and cable TV services. 2X points per $1 spent on the first $50,000 spent in combined purchases at gas stations and hotels. <b>This card offers a sign up bonus of 60,000 UR points and the annual fee is $95. I suggest that this is a great card to keep if you do a lot of business ransactions or you are in need of a business card.</b> This card can be combined with Sapphire as well, which is its another advantage.</p>

  <div class="heading">Things to keep in mind with Credit Cards</div>
<div class="lower">
<div class="justify">
<p>I would recommend all my readers or anyone else who are using credit cards to pay their balance in full every month. Credit card companies have a lot of offers and they compensate these offers by charging a hefty APR (generally around 12% - 20%). Also paying your credit cards in full every month keeps your credit score healthy so I will urge everyone to pay their credit cards in full every month.</p>
